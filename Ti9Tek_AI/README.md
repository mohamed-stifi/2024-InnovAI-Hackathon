## Introduction

In today's interconnected world, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we approach automation, efficiency, and data-driven decision-making. This project explores the development of a distributed AI-powered IoT system designed to process video streams from multiple sources in real time. The system demonstrates a scalable and modular architecture that combines advanced AI-based video analysis with distributed task management.

The core objective of this project is to create an intelligent system capable of detecting specific behaviors or objects in video feeds using state-of-the-art AI models. This is achieved by distributing the computational workload across multiple worker nodes, ensuring efficiency, fault tolerance, and scalability. Additionally, the system integrates a real-time notification mechanism using WhatsApp, allowing stakeholders to be alerted immediately when the system detects predefined events of interest.

This report delves into the design, implementation, and testing phases of the project, highlighting key components such as video streaming, distributed task allocation, AI-based video analysis using object detection models like DETR (DEtection TRansformer), and the notification system. The architecture leverages Python's socket programming for video transmission, XML-RPC for task management, and PyWhatKit for real-time WhatsApp notifications.

By combining IoT and AI in a distributed framework, this project provides a robust solution for real-time video surveillance and monitoring, making it ideal for applications in security, traffic management, and industrial automation. The following sections detail the system's architecture, code implementation, and the testing process, providing a comprehensive view of the project's functionality and potential real-world applications.
